## The travel blog website, Wanderlust Wonders, is live here: https://wanderlust-wonders.onrender.com

## Project overview

The goal of the project was to create a blog web application built using node.js and express.js on the backend, with EJS as the templating engine to generate dynamic HTML and CSS for styling. 
The website allows users to create, view and manage blog posts, however posts do not persist between sessions as no database has been used in this version of the application.
